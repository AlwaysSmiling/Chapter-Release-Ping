# Chapter Release Ping Bot


A Discord bot to keep track of and ping roles for chapter releases of Birth of the Demonic Sword and Chaos' Heir. 

The Current version does not use any database and has urls, channel ids, and role ids hardcoded in. 
If you wish to modify the bot for your own uses, you are welcome to do so, the current code is fairly simple and should be easily understandable. 

If any queries you can contact me at my Discord `@Smiling Person#8045`
